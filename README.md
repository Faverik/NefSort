# NefSort
Program for files sorting with several options
This program sorts the files in the specified folder or subfolders. 
To sort, the file extension and the date of their last modification are used. 
There is a kind of graphical interface and the ability to select a couple of options. 
The code is not optimized, there is an opportunity to significantly improve its simplicity.
The utility does not sort itself :) so you can throw it into any folder. 
Sorting creates new files without erasing old ones, fow now.
You can use the source code and run it in IDLE , Or you can just run the executable file with the extension .pyc
Wait for the message "Done!"
